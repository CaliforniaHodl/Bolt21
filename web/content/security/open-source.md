# Open Source Transparency

Bolt21 is completely open source. We believe security comes from transparency, not obscurity.

## Why Open Source?

### Verifiable Security
Anyone can audit our code to verify:
- We don't have backdoors
- We don't collect your data
- We don't have access to your keys
- Our security claims are accurate

### Community Review
Open source enables:
- Security researchers to find vulnerabilities
- Developers to contribute improvements
- Users to verify our claims
- Independent security audits

### Trust Through Transparency
You don't have to trust us - you can verify everything yourself.
