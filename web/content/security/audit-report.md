# Security Audit Report

**Date**: December 2024
**Grade**: A-
**Status**: All critical issues resolved

## Executive Summary

Bolt21 underwent a comprehensive security audit covering mobile application security, network security, and cryptographic implementations. All critical (P0) and high-priority (P1) vulnerabilities have been remediated.

## Audit Scope

| Area | Coverage |
|------|----------|
| Mobile App (Flutter) | Full review |
| iOS Native (Swift) | Full review |
| Android Native (Kotlin) | Full review |
| Network Security | Full review |
| Cryptography | Full review |
| Authentication | Full review |

## Findings Summary

### Resolved Issues

| Priority | Finding | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| P0 | Certificate pinning for Community Node | ✅ Fixed |
| P0 | Certificate pinning for GitHub (updates) | ✅ Fixed |
| P1 | Biometric bypass via split payments | ✅ Fixed |
| P1 | TrustKit version pinning | ✅ Fixed |

### Intentional Exceptions

| Finding | Decision | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| CoinGecko certificate pinning | Not pinned | CoinGecko rotates certificates frequently, making pinning impractical. Price data is display-only and cannot affect fund security. |
| LND node connection | User-controlled | Users connect to their own LND nodes. They control both endpoints of the connection. |

### Security Strengths

The audit identified several strong security practices:

1. **Cryptography**: AES-256-GCM encryption with secure random nonces
2. **Secret Management**: No hardcoded API keys, proper use of build-time flags
3. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive address validation including unicode attack prevention
4. **Secure Logging**: Custom SecureLogger redacts sensitive data (mnemonics, keys, addresses)
5. **SSRF Protection**: Community node URL validator blocks private IPs/localhost
6. **Backup Prevention**: Android backup disabled to protect wallet data

## Detailed Findings

### P0-01: Missing Certificate Pinning (Community Node)

**Risk**: Man-in-the-middle attacks could intercept Community Node communications

**Remediation**: Added Let's Encrypt certificate pins for `community.bolt21.io` on both Android and iOS

**Files Changed**:
- `android/app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml`
- `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift`

### P0-02: Missing Certificate Pinning (GitHub)

**Risk**: Update check could be manipulated to serve malicious versions

**Remediation**: Added DigiCert certificate pins for `github.com`, `api.github.com`, and `raw.githubusercontent.com`

**Files Changed**:
- `android/app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml`
- `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift`

### P1-01: Biometric Bypass via Split Payments

**Risk**: Attacker could drain wallet by sending multiple payments under 100k sat threshold

**Remediation**: Implemented `PaymentTrackerService` with:
- 5-minute rolling window for payment tracking
- Cumulative threshold detection
- Biometric required when cumulative amount exceeds 100k sats

**Files Changed**:
- `lib/services/payment_tracker_service.dart` (new)
- `lib/screens/send_screen.dart`

## Test Coverage

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Tests | 456 |
| Pass Rate | 100% |
| Test Categories | Unit, Widget, Integration |

## Recommendations

### Implemented
- ✅ Certificate pinning for all critical domains
- ✅ Cumulative payment tracking
- ✅ Exact version pinning for security dependencies

### Future Considerations
- Consider adding certificate pin expiration monitoring
- Evaluate migration to explicit pinning library (e.g., dio_certificate_pinner)
- Add automated security regression tests

## Verification

All security implementations are open source and can be verified:

- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/CaliforniaHodl/Bolt21)
