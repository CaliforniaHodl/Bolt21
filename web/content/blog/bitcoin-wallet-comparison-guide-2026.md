# Bitcoin Wallet Comparison 2026: Choosing the Right Wallet for Your Needs

Choosing the right Bitcoin wallet can feel overwhelming with hundreds of options available. This comprehensive comparison guides you through wallet types, features, and trade-offs to help you select the perfect wallet for your specific needs in 2026.

## Understanding Wallet Categories

Bitcoin wallets fall into several categories, each serving different use cases.

### Custodial vs. Non-Custodial

The most fundamental distinction:

**Custodial Wallets:**

**Non-Custodial Wallets:**
- You control your private keys
- Examples: Hardware wallets, [Bolt21](/features), Bitcoin Core
- Pros: True ownership, self-sovereignty
- Cons: Responsible for security and backups

**Recommendation:** Choose non-custodial for any significant amount.

### Hot vs. Cold Wallets

Based on internet connectivity:

**Hot Wallets:**
- Connected to internet
- Examples: Mobile apps, desktop software, web wallets
