## Security Best Practices

Regardless of which wallet you choose:

### 1. Backup Your Recovery Phrase
- Write it down on paper
- Store it safely offline
- Never take a screenshot
- Verify it works before depositing large amounts

### 2. Enable Biometric Authentication
- Use Face ID, Touch ID, or fingerprint
- Adds a layer of security for daily access
- Recovery phrase is still the ultimate backup

### 3. Start Small
- Test with small amounts first
- Practice sending and receiving
- Understand the interface before depositing serious money

### 4. Keep Your OS Updated
- Install security updates promptly
- Use official app stores only
- Be cautious of phishing apps

### 5. Consider a Hardware Wallet for Savings
- Mobile wallets are for spending money
- Large amounts should be in cold storage (hardware wallet)
- Think of it like wallet (phone) vs safe (hardware wallet)

## Special Mention: Custodial Wallets (Not Recommended)

These wallets hold your keys for you. We don't recommend them for primary use:

- **Wallet of Satoshi**: Very easy, but fully custodial
- **Strike**: Great UX, but not self-custodial
- **Cash App**: Convenient, but you don't control the Bitcoin

**Remember**: Not your keys, not your Bitcoin.

Use these only for spending amounts you can afford to lose, like you would with cash in your physical wallet.

## The Future: What's Coming

### BOLT12 Adoption
More wallets will add BOLT12 support in 2024-2025:
- Phoenix (announced)
- BlueWallet (under consideration)
- Others following

Bolt21 already has native support.

### Lightning Improvements
- Better channel management
- Lower fees
- Improved reliability
- More LSP options

### Privacy Enhancements
- Taproot adoption
- Silent payments
- Improved coin control

## Our Recommendation

**For most users**: Start with **Bolt21** (if you need BOLT12) or **Phoenix** (for simplest Lightning).

**As you learn**: Experiment with BlueWallet for on-chain + Lightning versatility.

**For privacy**: Graduate to Electrum with your own server.

**For savings**: Use a hardware wallet (Coldcard, Trezor, Ledger) and only keep spending money on mobile.
