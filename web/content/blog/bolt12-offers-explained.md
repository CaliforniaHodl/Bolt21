# BOLT12 Offers: Reusable Lightning Addresses That Never Expire

If you've used Lightning Network before, you know the frustration: generate an invoice, share it, but it expires in an hour. Need another payment? Generate a new invoice. It's tedious.

BOLT12 offers solve this problem completely.

## What is BOLT12?

BOLT12 is a new Lightning Network specification that introduces **Offers** - reusable payment endpoints that never expire.

Think of it like:
- **BOLT11 (old)**: A check made out for a specific amount that expires
- **BOLT12 (new)**: Your bank account number - share it once, receive unlimited payments

## The Problem with BOLT11 Invoices

Current Lightning invoices (BOLT11) have several limitations:

### Single-Use Only
Each invoice can only be paid once. Want to receive multiple payments? Generate multiple invoices.

### Expiration
Most invoices expire in 1 hour. If your customer waits too long, the invoice is invalid.

### Fixed Amounts
Invoices specify an exact amount. If you want to receive variable amounts, you need to generate custom invoices for each payment.

### Privacy Concerns
Invoices contain your node's public key, linking all your payments together.

## How BOLT12 Offers Work

A BOLT12 offer is a compact QR code or text string that you can share publicly.

### The Flow

1. **Merchant creates an offer** - This is the reusable payment endpoint
2. **Customer scans the offer** - Using their Lightning wallet
3. **Customer's wallet requests an invoice** - Behind the scenes, automatically
4. **Merchant's wallet sends a custom invoice** - Generated on the fly
5. **Payment completes** - Customer pays the invoice
6. **Everyone's happy** - No expiration, no manual invoice generation

### The Magic

The offer itself contains minimal information - it's just an endpoint. The actual invoice is generated when needed, providing:
- Fresh, non-expired invoices every time
- Custom amounts (customer can choose or merchant can specify)
- Improved privacy (each invoice is unique)
- Infinite reusability

## Benefits of BOLT12 Offers

### For Merchants

**Print Once, Use Forever**
- Put your offer QR code on business cards
- Display at your physical location
- Embed on your website
- No more updating expired QR codes

**Variable Amounts**
Customers can send any amount, or you can specify a minimum/maximum.

**Simplified Accounting**
All payments come to the same offer - easier to track and reconcile.

### For Content Creators

**Donations Made Easy**
Put your offer in:
- YouTube descriptions
- Podcast show notes
- Blog sidebars
- Social media bios

Fans can support you with any amount, anytime.

### For Bitcoin Miners

**Set and Forget**

Ocean Mining Pool supports BOLT12 offers, making Bolt21 the perfect wallet for miners.

### For Everyone

**Better Privacy**
Each payment uses a fresh invoice with unique payment details, making it harder to link your transactions.

**Simpler Experience**
Share one QR code instead of generating new invoices constantly.

**No Expiration Worries**
Your offer works today, tomorrow, and forever.

## BOLT12 vs Other Solutions

### Lightning Address (user@domain.com)

**Similarities:**
- Both provide reusable payment endpoints
- Both enable variable amount payments

**Differences:**
- Lightning Address requires a web server and domain
- BOLT12 offers work with just a wallet
- Lightning Address relies on centralized DNS
- BOLT12 is native to Lightning protocol

### LNURL

**Similarities:**
- Both enable advanced Lightning features
- Both support reusable payments

**Differences:**
- LNURL requires HTTP servers
- BOLT12 is pure Lightning protocol

### Traditional Bitcoin Addresses

**Similarities:**
- Both can be reused (though you shouldn't reuse Bitcoin addresses)

**Differences:**
- BOLT12 is for Lightning (instant, low-fee)
- Bitcoin addresses are on-chain (slower, higher fees)
- BOLT12 offers better privacy than address reuse

## The Future of Lightning Payments

BOLT12 is still relatively new, with wallet support growing throughout 2024. But it's quickly becoming the standard for:

- Merchant payments
- Donation/tipping platforms
- Subscription services
- Mining pool payouts
- Any scenario requiring reusable payment endpoints

### Current Support

**Wallets:**
- Bolt21 (full support)
- Core Lightning (reference implementation)
- Phoenix (coming soon)
- Others adding support throughout 2024

**Services:**
- Ocean Mining Pool
- BTCPay Server (in development)
- Various merchant solutions

## Common Questions

**Can I use one offer for multiple purposes?**
Yes! You can use the same offer for your coffee shop, online store, and donations. However, separate offers make accounting easier.

**What if my wallet is offline?**
Your wallet needs to be online (or using a Lightning Service Provider) to generate invoices when someone tries to pay your offer. Bolt21 handles this automatically.

**Are offers backward compatible?**
BOLT11 wallets can't pay BOLT12 offers (yet). Most modern wallets are adding support. In the meantime, you can offer both BOLT11 invoices and BOLT12 offers.

**Can I cancel an offer?**
You can stop responding to payment requests for an offer, effectively "canceling" it. But the offer string itself can't be revoked once shared.
