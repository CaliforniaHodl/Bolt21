# Bitcoin Payment Security: Best Practices to Protect Your Funds

Bitcoin's security is one of its greatest strengths - but only if you use it correctly. With self-custodial wallets, you're your own bank. That's empowering, but it comes with responsibility.

Here's everything you need to know to keep your Bitcoin secure.

## The Golden Rules of Bitcoin Security

### Rule 1: Protect Your Recovery Phrase Like Your Life Savings
Because that's exactly what it is.

**Your 12-24 word recovery phrase**:
- Gives complete access to your Bitcoin
- Cannot be reset or changed
- Is the ONLY way to recover your wallet
- Should NEVER be shared with anyone

**If someone has your recovery phrase, they own your Bitcoin. Period.**

### Rule 2: Never Trust, Always Verify
Before sending Bitcoin:
- Triple-check the recipient address
- Verify amounts carefully
- Confirm you're on the official app/website
- Question any urgent payment requests

### Rule 3: Start Small, Test First
Before sending large amounts:
- Send a small test transaction
- Verify it arrives correctly
- Then send the full amount

The few cents in fees are worth the peace of mind.

## Securing Your Recovery Phrase

### What NOT to Do

**Never:**
- Store it digitally (no photos, no files, no cloud)
- Share it with anyone (support, friends, family)
- Store it in email or messages
- Use password managers for it
- Keep it near your computer

### What TO Do

**Do:**
- Write it on paper (or metal)
- Store in a fireproof safe
- Consider a bank safe deposit box for large amounts
- Keep it separate from your wallet instructions
- Create multiple copies in different secure locations

### Advanced: Metal Backup Plates

For long-term storage:
- Fireproof
- Waterproof
- Crush-resistant
- Lasts decades

Products like Cryptosteel, Billfodl, or simple metal stamps work great.

### Verifying Your Backup

After writing down your recovery phrase:

1. Delete the wallet from your device
2. Restore using your written backup
3. Verify it works correctly
4. NOW you know your backup is valid

## Wallet Security Best Practices

### Use Biometric Authentication
Enable Face ID, Touch ID, or fingerprint lock:
- Quick daily access
- Protects against casual theft
- Doesn't replace recovery phrase backup

### Keep Your Device Secure

**Operating System:**
- Install security updates promptly
- Use official OS only (no jailbreak/root)
- Enable device encryption
- Use a strong device passcode

**Apps:**
- Download wallets from official sources only
- Verify the developer/publisher
- Check reviews and download counts
- Be wary of fake apps

### Beware of Malware

**On Mobile:**
- Don't install apps from unknown sources
- Be cautious of apps requesting excessive permissions
- Use reputable antivirus (if on Android)

**On Desktop:**
- Be extremely careful - desktop is higher risk
- Consider dedicated wallet device
- Use hardware wallet for large amounts

## Transaction Security

### Verify Addresses Carefully

**Clipboard Malware** is real:
- Copies an address
- Pastes attacker's address instead
- You send Bitcoin to scammer

**Prevention:**
- Always visually verify addresses
- Check first AND last characters
- For large amounts, verify via different channel (phone call, in person)

### Understand Address Formats

Bitcoin has several address formats:

- **Legacy (1...)**: Older, higher fees
- **SegWit (3... or bc1q...)**: Lower fees, most common
- **Taproot (bc1p...)**: Newest, best privacy

All are valid. Your wallet handles this automatically, but understanding helps you verify addresses.

### Be Careful with QR Codes

QR codes are convenient but:
- Verify the address shown matches the QR code
- Be cautious of QR codes from untrusted sources
- Scammers can swap QR stickers on posters/flyers

### Set Appropriate Fees

**Too low**: Transaction might never confirm
**Too high**: You overpay unnecessarily

Most wallets suggest appropriate fees automatically. For Lightning, fees are negligible so this mainly applies to on-chain transactions.

## Common Scams to Avoid

### Phishing Attacks

**What it looks like:**
- Email/message claiming to be from your wallet provider
- Asks you to "verify" or "restore" your wallet
- Links to fake website that steals your recovery phrase

**Protection:**
- Legitimate wallets NEVER ask for your recovery phrase
- Bookmark official websites, don't click email links
- Verify URLs carefully (look for https:// and exact spelling)
- When in doubt, go directly to official site, don't use links

### Fake Support

**What it looks like:**
- Someone DMs you offering to "help"
- Claims to be customer support
- Asks for your recovery phrase to "fix" an issue

**Protection:**
- Official support NEVER DMs first
- They NEVER ask for recovery phrases
- Block and report these accounts
- Seek help only through official channels

### Investment Scams

**What it looks like:**
- "Send 1 BTC, get 2 BTC back!"
- "Bitcoin doubling service"
- Fake celebrity endorsements
- Too-good-to-be-true returns

**Protection:**
- If it sounds too good to be true, it is
- No legitimate service doubles your Bitcoin
- Research thoroughly before investing
- Be especially wary of schemes promising guaranteed returns

### Clipboard Hijacking

**What it looks like:**
- Copy a Bitcoin address
- Paste it, but different address appears
- Malware replaced it with attacker's address

**Protection:**
- Always verify the full address after pasting
- Use reputable security software
- Keep your OS and apps updated

### Fake Wallets

**What it looks like:**
- App with similar name to popular wallet
- Fake website looking identical to real one
- Steals your Bitcoin when you create "wallet"

**Protection:**
- Download only from official sources
- Verify the developer/company
- Check the exact URL (bolt21.io not bo1t21.io)
- Look for official verification badges

## Lightning-Specific Security

### Channel Management

**Risk**: If your Lightning node goes offline and your channel partner publishes an old state, you could lose funds.

**Mitigation**:
- Use wallets with automatic watchtowers (like Bolt21)
- Don't run a Lightning node on unreliable hardware
- For large amounts, use on-chain Bitcoin

### Keep Smaller Amounts in Lightning

Lightning is perfect for spending money, but:
- Keep daily/weekly spending amounts
- Store savings in on-chain Bitcoin or cold storage
- Think: Lightning = wallet, Cold storage = safe

### BOLT12 Offer Security

BOLT12 offers are safe to share publicly:
- They don't reveal your balance
- They can't be used to steal funds
- They're just payment endpoints

**But:**
- Don't link them to personal identity if privacy is important
- You can create multiple offers for different purposes

## Privacy Considerations

### Address Reuse

**Don't reuse Bitcoin addresses:**
- Hurts your privacy
- Links all transactions together
- Makes balance public

**Modern wallets** (including Bolt21) generate new addresses automatically.

### Lightning Privacy

Lightning is more private than on-chain:
- Payments don't appear on public blockchain
- Route is obscured
- Amounts are only known by sender/receiver

**But still:**
- Don't link Lightning wallet to real identity if privacy matters
- Use Tor for maximum privacy (advanced users)

## Multi-Layered Security Strategy

### Layer 1: Hot Wallet (Mobile)
**Amount**: Daily/weekly spending
**Examples**: Bolt21, Phoenix, BlueWallet
**Security**: Recovery phrase + biometrics

### Layer 2: Warm Storage (Desktop/Hardware)
**Amount**: Monthly spending, mid-term holds
**Examples**: Hardware wallet, desktop wallet
**Security**: Hardware device + PIN + recovery phrase

### Layer 3: Cold Storage (Offline)
**Amount**: Long-term savings, large amounts
**Examples**: Hardware wallet, paper wallet (advanced)
**Security**: Completely offline, physically secured

**The Strategy:**
- Most funds in cold storage
- Medium amounts in warm storage
- Only spending money in hot wallet
- Transfer between layers as needed

## What to Do If Something Goes Wrong

### If You Lose Your Phone

1. **Don't panic** - your Bitcoin is safe if you have your recovery phrase
2. **Get a new device**
3. **Download your wallet app**
4. **Restore using recovery phrase**
5. **Your funds reappear**

### If You Think Your Wallet is Compromised

1. **Act immediately**
2. **Create new wallet** (different app, fresh recovery phrase)
3. **Transfer all funds** to new wallet
4. **Abandon old wallet**
5. **Never use old recovery phrase again**

### If You Sent to Wrong Address

Unfortunately, Bitcoin transactions are irreversible:
- Can't be cancelled
- Can't be refunded automatically
- Only the recipient can send it back

**Prevention is critical** - always verify addresses!

### If You Suspect a Scam

1. **Stop all communication** with the suspected scammer
2. **Do NOT send more money** trying to "unlock" or "verify"
3. **Report** to relevant authorities/platforms
4. **Learn and move on** - don't let one mistake paralyze you
